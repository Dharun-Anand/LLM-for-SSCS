# LLM-Scored-23

This repository contains the supplementary data for the paper titled "An Empirical Study on Using Large Language Models to Analyze Software Supply Chain Security Failures". 

There are 6 files in this repository. 

### In src:
1. GptPrompts.py:                                                                       
This file contains the code for prompting GPT 3.5's response to the various prompts used in the paper.\
There are functions for each dimension:\
type()- runs the prompt for all articles for the dimension 'type of compromise'. \
impacts()- is for the dimension 'impacts'\
nature()- is for the dimension 'nature'\
solution()- is for the dimension 'Solutions/learnings'\
intent()- is for the dimension 'intent'

2. BardPrompts.py:
This file contains the code for prompting Bard's response to the various prompts used in the paper.\
The function 'classification()' contains all the prompts for Bard. Various variables contain the different prompts.\
For example, 'intent_prompt' contains the prompt for the intent dimension and so on. 

### In data:
3. Appendix.pdf: 
This pdf contains the appendix for the paper with the following items: \
  A.1. Trend in accuracy of LLMsâ€™ response over time \
  A.2. Distribution of ground truth for various dimensions \
  A.3. The final prompts for each dimension \
  A.4. Solutions and Learnings response 

5. articles.csv: 
Contains all the articles in the catalog used as the dataset for the study in a CSV format.\
The catalog being referred to here is a collection of articles on software supply chain failures collected by CNCF.\
The link to this catalogue: https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/tree/main/supply-chain-security/compromises

6. articles.py:
Contains all the articles in the catalog used as the dataset for the study.\
For example, 'article1' contains the content of the first article in the catalog (sorted by the most recent article).\

7. Manual Labels.xlsx
This Excel file contains the manual labels of the catalog from the 3 pairs of 2 analysts and their interrater agreement scores.

8. LLM Data.xlsx


3. Classifying articles-analysis.xlsx (OTDATED - REMOVE)
This Excel file contains the manual labelling by the raters for each article.\
It also contains the calculation for both the accuracy of GPT (GPT analysis) and Bard (Bard analysis).
